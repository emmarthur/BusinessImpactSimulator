## Frontend Feature Ideas

- **Animated background**: Animated gradient or particle background with a subtle parallax effect.
- **Drag-and-drop upload**: File upload with a visual dropzone and drag-over highlight.
- **Live field preview**: Display detected project fields in real time, with badges for missing values.
- **Theme toggle**: Light/dark themes; include a minimalist status/progress bar during parsing.
- **Friendly validation & tips**: Inline hints for manual entry and gentle validation messages.
- **Sample project button**: One-click to auto-fill demo content for learning/testing.
- **Local history**: Store recent uploads in the browser and allow quick restore/compare.
- **Accessibility**: Clear focus states, keyboard upload support, and ARIA labels for controls.
